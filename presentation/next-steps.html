    <!-- #NICE TO HAVES THAT I KNOW HOW TO IMPLEMENT BUT DIDN'T DUE TO LACK OF TIME:
""" > Use colorama library to customize the color of the text
    > Use time library to edit how fast/slow specific code is executed
    > Personalize the game more by asking for their name"""

# FUTURE UPDATES THAT NEED ADDITIONAL RESEARCH:
""" 
> Player can guess the entire word 
> Player can choose level of difficulty which changes how many attempts they have available to them
> Player can choose a theme for the mystery words they are guessing. Each theme pulls up a different list of mystery words.
> Make a version en Espanol :)
> If sounds can be played from terminal, add sounds """ -->
